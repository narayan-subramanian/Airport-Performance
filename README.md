# Leveraging US Airport Performance to Propel India's Aviation Industry

## Abstract
Abstractâ€”The research study provides a comparative examination of selective international airports in the USA from 1988 to 2020, concentrating on their performance in terms of delays, infrastructure, and the number of flights served. The study uses publicly available data to identify patterns in each airport's operational performance and examine how each airport has changed over time. Over the years, each airport has encountered unique challenges and experienced a variety of triumphs, with some performing better than others in key areas. For instance, certain airports have made significant investments in technology and infrastructure, which have 
aided in reducing delays and enhancing the traveler experience. Others have struggled to meet the demand, which has resulted in crowding and higher wait times. This will help us to explore the key takeaways that may be drawn from how airports operate. The need of investing in infrastructure, technology, and personnel development in order to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction is emphasized. The insights of this research may be useful to stakeholders and policymakers in the Indian aviation sector, assisting them in understanding the difficulties airports face and creating solutions. Overall, this study represents a crucial step  towards teaching India how to create a strong and sustainable aviation industry that would contribute to the economic development of the nation.


## Dataset
**The Airline Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance**, provided by IBM, is used for studying flight performance and trends in the airline industry. It has comprehensive historical flight performance data for domestic and international flights in the USA, with information on flight arrival and departure times, flight
routes, flight distance, carrier information, etc. 
The initial dataset contains 200 million records. However, for the sake of research, a subset of the data was used, focusing on seven major airports in the USA from 1987 to 2020. The dataset was scaled down from 200 million records to 1 million records using year-based filtering and then location-based filtering. To ensure that the data could be loaded into Power BI and relevant processing could be done, downsampling is necessary as the dataset becomes more manageable.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, various insights have been gained from the examination of the top 7 busiest international airports in the US. First off, even while the number of passengers is largely stable, there is still room to improve airport infrastructure, especially in terms of cutting down on delays. The biggest delays have often been seen at ORD, JFK, and LAX, respectively. Even ORD, though, has experienced delays recently. Second, each of the seven airports serves as a significant hub with great connection both within the region and to the rest of the world. Thirdly, these airports produce a considerable quantity of income and offer a large number of employment opportunities. Regarding consumer satisfaction, ATL tops the chart while SFO has also done well. LAX has had significant swings over the years, demonstrating that improvements are being made. ORD has a poor track record when it comes to client satisfaction. Fourthly, all airports are making efforts to be environmentally sustainable and hope to achieve success by 2030. India can make the necessary expenditures to upgrade its airport infrastructure and build
more effective airports with improved customer experiences, job opportunities, and environmental sustainability by taking each of these factors into account.
